TWELVE COLUMN RESPONSIVE GRID
=============================

This is a grid system I've been using on a projects for a while that has evolved over time.

I know the world doesn't need another grid system. Basically I'm using this because I understand it and control it myself, and it's fairly light in terms of overhead.  (one SCSS) file. 

The file you need is the _responsive-grid.scss. Import that into your project and compile your SASS, or copy and and paste it into your regular CSS file (Why aren't you using a precompiler?!). There are no mixins or variables to deal with.
